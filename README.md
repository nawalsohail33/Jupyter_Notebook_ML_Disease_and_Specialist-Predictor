# Disease and Specialist Prediction System

This AI-based system predicts a patient's likely disease based on symptoms and suggests the most relevant medical specialist. It uses a synthetically generated medical dataset with rule-based logic and machine learning models.



##  Features

- Automatically matches symptoms to possible diseases
- Recommends an appropriate medical specialist
- Uses a synthetic dataset designed to simulate real-world symptoms
- Employs basic classification algorithms (linear regression) for prediction


## Dataset

The dataset is generated using Python and simulates realistic patient data:
- 300+ synthetic entries
- Each entry includes:  
  Symptoms → Condition → Specialist

How It Works
Generate synthetic data using symptom-disease-specialist mapping

Save and load this data as a CSV

Use ML models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) for:

Predicting the condition

Recommending the specialist

Machine Learning
You can plug in any classifier (like LogisticRegression, RandomForestClassifier, etc.) and evaluate:

Accuracy

Confusion Matrix

Prediction examples

This is a part of the project I have already uploaded about the Disease and Specialist Predictor on my github. It is the jupyter file and contains the models and AI related stuff for the project and models from this are imported and used in the Django file.

Clone the repo

Run Project_ai.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook

Make sure dependencies (pandas, sklearn, etc.) are installed

Thanks for reading this far. Hope you like my work.!!!
